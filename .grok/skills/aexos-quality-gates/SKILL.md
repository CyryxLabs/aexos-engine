# AEXOS Quality Gates

## Required local gates

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

Optional / pre-push:

```bash
npm run build
# CodeRabbit when available (see coderabbit skill / WSL notes)
```

## Agent rules

- @dev: run gates before marking story ready for review.
- @qa: gates are necessary but not sufficient — still do AC + architecture review.
- @devops: MUST run pre-push gate before any push/PR.

## Failures

Fix root cause. Do not use `--no-verify` or skip hooks to force green.
