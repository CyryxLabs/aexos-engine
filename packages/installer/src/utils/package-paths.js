 * The scope is consolidated on a single npm org, `@aexos`, so the core package

 * owning two organisations.
 *
 * Because the unscoped half of that name is `core`, npm would infer a binary
 * called `core` for `npx @aexos/core <command>`. Root `package.json` therefore
 * declares an explicit `core` bin alias; without it npx exits with
 * `could not determine executable to run`.
 *
 * Every earlier name stays recognised. A project installed under an older name
 * still has that name in its own node_modules, and refusing to see it would
 * break the very upgrade path that renames it.
